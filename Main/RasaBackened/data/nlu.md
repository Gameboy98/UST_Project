##intent: overfitting
- what is overfitting?
- what is the defination of overfitting

When a model is excessively complex, overfitting is normally observed, because of having too many parameters with respect to the number of training data types. The model exhibits poor performance which has been overfit.

## intent :	logistic_Regression
- what is Logistic Regression?
- how do you define Logistic Regression
- what is meant by Logistic Regression
- describe Logistic Regression

<!-- Logistic regression is actually a binomial classifier that acts like a light switch. A light switch essentially has two states, on and off. Logistic regression takes input data and classifies it as category or not_category, on or off expressed as 1 or 0, based on the strength of the input’s signal. So it’s a light switch for signal that you find in the data. -->


## intent : decisiontree
- what is decisiontree?
- how do you define decisiontree
- what is meant by decisiontree
- describe decisiontree

<!-- A decision tree is a series of nodes, a directional graph that starts at the base with a single node and extends to the many leaf nodes that represent the categories that the tree can classify. Another way to think of a decision tree is as a flow chart, where the flow starts at the root node and ends with a decision made at the leaves. It is a decision-support tool. It uses a tree-like graph to show the predictions that result from a series of feature-based splits. -->
